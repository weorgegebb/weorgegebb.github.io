                                        solve. I take what I have previously learnt and then look at what can be
                                        applied
                                        to the
                                        problem at hand. I also try to draw similarities to work I have previously
                                        completed, to
                                        identify if a technique that worked there may be appropriate in the new

                                        I am also
                                        not afraid to look for an alternative approach. Some problems require a more
                                        creative
                                        approach or for an entirely new approach to be taken. As a hobby, I enjoy
                                        playing and
                                        writing music. This give me a creative outlet and often allows me to look at
                                        a
                                        problem in a

                                        Ultimate Frisbee, I have organised and ran multiple events, such as an
                                        awards
                                        evening and a
                                        national tournament for new frisbee players. This tournament was held over
                                        two
                                        days and
                                        featured 36 teams from around the country. I organised the playing venue,
                                        the
                                        tournament

                                        fundraising events for the Youth Sports Trust. I am well organised and can

                                        efficiently, such as with my individual final year project.</p>

                                        used Matlab and Simulink extensively to design a collision avoidance

                                        and learn both C++ and Python. I continue to learn and develop my skills in
                                        these languages.
                                        I have also had some experience with version control (Git/Github). My work
