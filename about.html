                            identify if a technique that worked there may be appropriate in the new problem. I am also
                            not afraid to look for an alternative approach. Some problems require a more creative
                            approach or for an entirely new approach to be taken. As a hobby, I enjoy playing and
                            writing music. This give me a creative outlet and often allows me to look at a problem in a

                            continue to develop these skills with the presentations I give and reports that I write.</p>

                            Ultimate Frisbee, I have organised and ran multiple events, such as an awards evening and a
                            national tournament for new frisbee players. This tournament was held over two days and
                            featured 36 teams from around the country. I organised the playing venue, the tournament
                            schedule and accommodation for all the teams involved. I have also organised alumni
                            fundraising events for the Youth Sports Trust. I am well organised and can schedule my time
                            efficiently, such as with my individual final year project.</p>

                            Windows, Mac, Linux and Microsoft Office. As part of my final year individual project, I
                            used Matlab and Simulink extensively to design a collision avoidance algorithm for a UAV.
                            This, along with my work with Greengauge, has allowed me to develop my programming skills
                            and learn both C++ and Python. I continue to learn and develop my skills in these languages.
                            I have also had some experience with version control (Git/Github). My work at Greengauge has
                            also developed my interest in the Internet of Things.</p>
